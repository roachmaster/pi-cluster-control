Feature: Remote Command Execution Core

  Scenario: Execute shell command on target node
    Given the master sends a command "ls -la" to the agent
    When the agent receives the request
    Then it should execute the command in a secure subprocess
    And it should capture stdout and stderr

  Scenario: Return execution result to master
    Given the command has been executed
    When the output is available
    Then the agent should send the result and exit code back to the master

  Scenario: Handle command timeouts
    Given a command exceeds the maximum allowed time
    When the agent detects the timeout
    Then it should terminate the process
    And return a timeout error to the master

  Scenario: Sanitize and validate incoming commands
    Given the master sends a command string
    When the agent receives the command
    Then it should validate the command against a safe list or policy
    And reject potentially harmful operations like "rm -rf /"
