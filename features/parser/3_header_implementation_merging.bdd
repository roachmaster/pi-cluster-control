Feature: Support header and implementation file pairs

  Scenario: Support header and implementation file pairs
    Given a pair of header (.hpp) and implementation (.cpp) files
    When the parser processes them together
    Then it should merge metadata from both files
    And associate method definitions in .cpp with declarations in .hpp
