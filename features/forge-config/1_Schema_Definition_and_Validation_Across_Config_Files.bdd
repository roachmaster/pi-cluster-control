Feature: Schema Definition and Validation Across Config Files
  Scenario: Successful Schema Validation (Happy Path)
    Given a well-formed YAML configuration file "config/example.yaml" that conforms to the schema and has some optional keys missing
    When the file is loaded into the system
    Then the contents are validated against the predefined schema and default values are applied with no errors reported

  Scenario: Schema Validation Failure Due To Missing Required Keys
    Given a YAML configuration file "config/example.yaml" that is missing one or more required keys
    When the file is loaded into the system
    Then an error is returned indicating that required keys are missing

  Scenario: Schema Validation Failure Due To Invalid Values
    Given a YAML configuration file "config/example.yaml" that contains invalid values for required keys
    When the file is loaded into the system
    Then an error is returned indicating that some values are invalid

  Scenario: Empty File Scenario
    Given an empty YAML configuration file "config/example.yaml"
    When the file is loaded into the system
    Then an error is returned indicating that the file is empty or a default configuration is generated
