Feature: CMake Consistency & Hygiene

  Scenario: Bootstrap a new C++ project repository
    Given a valid modules.yaml file exists
    When I run the cppforge bootstrap command
    Then a root-level CMakeLists.txt should be generated
    And it should include all module directories
    And reflect the correct project name and CMake version

  Scenario: Detect missing source files in CMakeLists.txt
    Given a module has source files not listed in its CMakeLists.txt
    When I run cppforge validate
    Then it should report the missing source file references

  Scenario: Detect unused entries in CMakeLists.txt
    Given a moduleâ€™s CMakeLists.txt lists non-existent files
    When I run cppforge validate
    Then it should report the invalid entries
