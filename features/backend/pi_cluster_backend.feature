Feature: Backend Responsibilities for Pi Cluster Control

  Scenario: Authenticate and authorize users
    Given a user attempts to access the dashboard
    When the backend validates their credentials
    Then access should be granted or denied based on roles

  Scenario: Expose service API endpoints
    Given the system exposes REST or gRPC endpoints
    When a client sends a request to control an agent
    Then the backend should route the request appropriately

  Scenario: Collect and store agent telemetry
    Given agents send periodic metrics
    When the backend receives these metrics
    Then it should store them in a database for future analysis

  Scenario: Log events and errors
    Given events and failures occur in the system
    When the backend detects them
    Then it should log them persistently and timestamp them

  Scenario: Trigger rule-based automation
    Given a rule is configured for temperature thresholds
    When an agent reports temperature above 90Â°C
    Then the backend should issue a reboot command

  Scenario: Notify on critical conditions
    Given a Pi node goes offline
    When no heartbeat is received for X seconds
    Then the backend should notify the admin via alert channels

  Scenario: Stream real-time cluster updates
    Given the user is viewing the dashboard
    When new data is available
    Then the backend should push updates using WebSockets

  Scenario: Run regression checks on upstream modules
    Given changes are pushed to agent or master modules
    When the backend test suite is triggered
    Then it should validate no critical paths are broken

  Scenario: Handle script and config uploads
    Given a user uploads a new Ansible playbook or shell script
    When the backend receives the file
    Then it should store it and make it available for execution

  Scenario: Visualize system health
    Given multiple agents are reporting telemetry
    When the user opens the dashboard
    Then the backend should provide an aggregated view of CPU, memory, and disk
