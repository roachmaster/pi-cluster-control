Feature: Backend Interactivity and CI Integration

  Scenario: Stream real-time cluster updates
    Given the user is viewing the dashboard
    When new data is available
    Then the backend should push updates using WebSockets

  Scenario: Run regression checks on upstream modules
    Given changes are pushed to agent or master modules
    When the backend test suite is triggered
    Then it should validate no critical paths are broken

  Scenario: Handle script and config uploads
    Given a user uploads a new Ansible playbook or shell script
    When the backend receives the file
    Then it should store it and make it available for execution
