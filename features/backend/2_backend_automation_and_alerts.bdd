Feature: Backend Logging and Automation

  Scenario: Log events and errors
    Given events and failures occur in the system
    When the backend detects them
    Then it should log them persistently and timestamp them

  Scenario: Trigger rule-based automation
    Given a rule is configured for temperature thresholds
    When an agent reports temperature above 90Â°C
    Then the backend should issue a reboot command

  Scenario: Notify on critical conditions
    Given a Pi node goes offline
    When no heartbeat is received for X seconds
    Then the backend should notify the admin via alert channels
