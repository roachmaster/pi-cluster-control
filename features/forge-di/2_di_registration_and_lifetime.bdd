Feature: Register DI Components and Manage Lifetimes

  Scenario: Register components in the container
    Given extracted class and metadata
    When the DI module generates the container code
    Then it should include bindings for the class and its dependencies

  Scenario: Support singleton and scoped lifetimes
    Given a class is marked with a singleton macro
    When the container is initialized
    Then only one instance of the class should be created and shared
