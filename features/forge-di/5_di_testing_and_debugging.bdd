Feature: Support Testing and Debugging of DI System

  Scenario: Support testing by mocking dependencies
    Given a class has dependencies
    When running in test mode
    Then the DI system should allow mocks to be injected for isolated testing

  Scenario: Enable debug output for DI resolution
    Given the DI container is in debug mode
    When resolving a class
    Then it should print which concrete implementation was used
