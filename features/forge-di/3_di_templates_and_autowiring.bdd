Feature: Handle Templates and Method Autowiring in DI

  Scenario: Support template classes and interfaces
    Given a class uses C++ templates
    When the DI parser analyzes it
    Then it should register the concrete implementation against the correct interface

  Scenario: Autowire public methods
    Given a service class has public methods
    When the DI module processes the file
    Then it should collect method signatures for use in code generation
