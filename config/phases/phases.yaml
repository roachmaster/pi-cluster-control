PHASES:
  - PHASE: 0
    NAME: The Core
    GOAL: Establish a type-safe, lambda-driven declarative system for Forgeables.
    INCLUDES:
      - "forge-core: definitions, registry, resolver, provider"
      - "forge-engine: DAG executor for Forgeables"
      - "forge-config: YAML/JSON ingestion adapter"
      - "forge-api: interfaces to inject Forgeables and start processing"
    NOTES: This phase forms the operational baseline and enforces clean architectural boundaries.

  - PHASE: 1
    NAME: Memory-Mapped Forge Registry
    GOAL: Enable zero-latency Forgeable resolution via precompiled `.img` memory-mapped registries.
    INNOVATIONS:
      - "Binary layouts for Forge metadata"
      - "Offset-based lookup for stateless Forges"
      - "mmap-backed registry for instant startup and deterministic layout"

  - PHASE: 2
    NAME: Lifecycle-Aware Caching
    GOAL: Implement lifecycle-specific caching to improve object reuse and memory efficiency.
    STRATEGIES:
      - "ForgeableSingletonCache, ForgeableThreadLocalCache, ForgeableSessionCache"
      - "Precompilation of DAGs by lifecycle"
      - "Transitive dependency analysis for stateless inference"

  - PHASE: 3
    NAME: Local Forge Clustering
    GOAL: Distribute Forge services across CPU cores or LAN-connected machines.
    CAPABILITIES:
      - "Each microservice owns a specific Forge domain (e.g., goal, config, bdd)"
      - "Isolated registries and provider lifecycles per process"
      - "Inter-process communication via IPC, TCP, or shared memory"

  - PHASE: 4
    NAME: Distributed Memory & Persistence
    GOAL: Build a global Forge fabric with local specialization and smart routing.
    FEATURES:
      - "Memory-mapped registries per node"
      - "Sharded SQLite/ForgeDB persistence per Forge domain"
      - "DAG-aware routing of requests across the fabric"

  - PHASE: 5
    NAME: Fault Tolerance & Resilience
    GOAL: Orchestrate self-healing behavior in multi-node Forge clusters.
    ADVANCEMENTS:
      - "Failure detection and service replacement"
      - "Dynamic DAG rebalancing with failover tasks"
      - "Global cluster coordination with policy enforcement"

  - PHASE: 6
    NAME: Forge Intelligence (LLM Integration)
    GOAL: Empower Forge with intelligent agents for codegen, repair, and adaptation.
    VISION:
      - "Autogenerated Forgeables and runtime DSL pipelines"
      - "Scenario-aware failure healing via LLM agents"
      - "Prompt-memory graphs to carry long-term intent"
