PHASE: 2
NAME: Local Clustering
GOAL: Deploy Forge executables as microservices on a single machine or LAN.
GOALS:
  architecture:
    - Define service boundaries for forge-goal, forge-bdd, forge-config, etc.
    - Specify cluster-local API contract for task exchange
    - Design internal ForgeService metadata block for each instance

  messaging:
    - Implement IPC-based ForgeMessenger (Unix domain sockets or named pipes)
    - Allow ForgeApi to enqueue tasks from another Forge
    - Support JSON-based schema for internal service messages

  deployment:
    - Package each Forge module as a standalone executable
    - Write local launcher that spins up named Forge services
    - Enable CLI-based DAG submission to a selected local service

  runtime:
    - Implement dynamic dispatch of work between local services
    - Enable forge-core to remain minimal while forwarding to local daemons
    - Add runtime validation of ForgeApi contracts between services

  integration:
    - Test forge-config ingestion triggering forge-goal execution
    - Validate BDD scenarios flowing from forge-bdd â†’ forge-core
    - Create cluster-local registry of active Forge services
